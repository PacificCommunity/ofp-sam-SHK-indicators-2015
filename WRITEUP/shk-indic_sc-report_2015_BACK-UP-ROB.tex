\section{Introduction} % ltb rev 90% done

% This study provides indicators related to the stocks general trend, whether it has changed from the previous indicator analysis and if further analysis is warrented, how to undertake that analysis.  Uncertainty regarding any species population level mechanisims that drive any indivudal anlysis is qualitiatively expressed  by species and stock in order to represent the uncertainty in the underlying data.

Sharks are typically caught as bycatch in the Pacific tuna fisheries, though some directed and/or mixed species fisheries also exist. The status of the shark species designated as key shark species in 2011 (blue, mako, thresher, silky, and oceanic whitetip sharks) in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) \hlam{ADD REF} underwent a comprehensive review in 2011 \citep{Clarke2011_a}. That review presented a number of indicators to inform on the status of the stock of these shark species and their response to fishing pressure. Given the paucity of data availability for shark species compared to target species, the indicators they developed were based on the type of information typically available from operational-level data for industrial purse-seine and longline fleets. 

The current study updates key indicators and extends previous analyses to include hammerhead, porbeagle and whale sharks. This study covers the time period 1995-2014. While some observer and logbook data exist for years prior to 1995, the majority of records either do not report shark catch or list it as a general category `shark'.  At the time of analysis, sufficient data for 2014 was available both in logsheets and the observer data, notable exceptions from the observer database for 2014 are recent years for Australia and the United States whose most recent contributions were in 2013 and 2011 respectively.
%\hllb{Mention study period chosen here 1995-2014}.

\hlcoral{Add table of species names}\\
In this report, we present information on the geographic range of catches for each of the species considered; temporal trends in catch composition and catch rates, and key biological indicators of fishing pressure such as mean size and sex ratio by species. Whale sharks are assessed separately due to the unique nature of their interactions with fisheries in the WCPO. The analyses are based on Secretariat of the Pacific Community--Oceanic Fisheries Programme (SPC-OFP) data holdings for sharks taken in longline and purse seine fisheries in the WCPO.  They generally follow the framework first developed and described in the Shark Research Plan presented to the sixth meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission's (WCPFC) Scientific Committee (SC6; Clarke and Harley 2010).

This report is necessarily large. To assist the reader it has been structured along the following lines.
Following a brief description of the available data in section 2, each of the four indicator analyses
are described and results summarized in sections 3-6. Section 7 presents an overview of stock status indicators for whale sharks, as they have a rather unique interaction with the WCPO tuna fisheries. Section 8 presents a consideration of the
feasibility of conducting a formal stock assessment for each of the shark species discussed in this
report. In Section 9, we review the impact of recent shark management measures; conclusions arising from our analysis of stock indicators are summarized in section 10. Finally, section 11 discusses research recommendations to improve on the indicator analysis as well as management implications arising from the results of the work presented here.

\section{Description of Data}

The primary source of catch information regarding sharks is the SPC-held observer database which, despite low coverage in all regions (Table \ref{tbl:obscov}), has a substantial amount of information regarding operational characteristics as well as fate and condition data on captured sharks. Our measure of observer coverage is defined by "observed hooks set" and is used here because it is a ``common currency" and allows for the standardisation of observer coverage rates when undertaking analyses.  In addition to the observer data, SPC holds operational logsheet and aggregate data on shark catches by longline fisheries. The operational data submitted to the SPC are at a higher spatial resolution than the aggregate data, and are useful for catch estimation, but in practice their utility is limited by the lack of data provision by species for shark (Table \ref{tbl:logcov}), especially in equatorial regions where the majority of the longline effort occurs.

%The primary source of catch information regarding sharks is the SPC held observer data which, despite low coverage in all regions (Table 1 -\%Observer coverage by region) has a significant amount of information regarding operational characteristics as well as the fate and condition of sharks caught. In addition to the observer data, SPC holds operational logsheet and aggregate data on shark catches by longline fisheries. The operational data submitted to the SPC are at a higher spatial resolution, and are useful for catch estimation, but in practice the utility is limited by the lack of data provision by species for shark \hl{(Table 2 Logsheet coverage by region \% that ID sharks to species)}, especially in equatorial regions where the majority of the longline effort occurs
%(\ref{fig:regions}).

Aggregate coverage rates are on par with the coverage rates of the operational logsheet data sets, although coverage differs greatly by region (\hlam{Table 3 - NO SUCH TABLE CURRENTLY?!?}). Historical coverage rates are poor partly because prior to February 2011 sharks were not amongst the species for which data provision was required (WCPFC 2013); since that time, data provision for the 13 species designated by WCPFC as key shark species is mandatory . Under CMM 2007-01, required levels of Regional Observer Programme (ROP) coverage in longline fisheries are set to rise to 5\% from June 2012 in most areas, but annual average values have been $\leq$1\% in recent years (for the entire WCPO). With some notable exceptions (e.g. northeast and southwest of Hawaii), most observed sets occurred within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). A thorough examination of the SPC-held fisheries data and its utility for shark related analyses can be found in Clarke et al. (2011).

Building on the work of \citet{Clarke2011_a}, this indicator analysis uses the six WCPFC statistical areas as defined in the 2010 WCPFC bigeye tuna stock assessment (Figure \ref{fig:fig01}). As noted in \citet{Clarke2011_a}, these regions are somewhat arbitrarily assigned to the key shark species. However, given the fact that the predominant source of fishing mortality for these species is the longline fishery targeting tropical tunas (as well as billfishes and occasionally sharks), these regions adequately capture the important characteristics of the fisheries. Therefore, for purposes of comprehension and comparison to the previous analysis, we opted to keep the same regions. We note that the current bigeye tuna assessment utilizes a set of regions that differs from those used here, however as the change mostly consisted of subdividing a few of the large regions, and to maintain comparability with previous analyses, we opted to work with the six-region set as is.

\subsection{Longline Fishery Data}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Longline fishing effort in the WCPO has increased steadily over the study period (1995-2014) to approximately 800 million hooks, with nearly half of the effort occurring in Regions 3 and 4 (Table \ref{tab:hooksfished}).  Ideally, indicator analyses would be based on operational-level data as its higher spatial resolution permits more comprehensive and nuanced analyses, however SPC's operational level data is geographically limited with respect to provision of shark data.  Figure \ref{fig:fig02} illustrates the geographic distribution of sets for which SPC holds operational data (blue dots) and sets with at least one recorded shark are overplotted (in orange). However, this picture is somewhat misleading as only 41\% of the operational-level sets plotted recorded any sharks. This is in contrast to the observer data in which 93\% of the sets recorded at least one shark (overplotted in red).

This is not necessarily due to misreporting. Prior to February 2011, sharks were not amongst the species for which data provision was required \citep{WCPFC2011_a}; since that time data provision for the 13 species designated by WCPFC as key shark species has been mandatory. Figure \ref{fig:fig02} does not distinguish between key shark species and other shark species because only 16\% of the reported sets recorded any species-specific shark catches. Clarke et al. (2011b) note that most historical species-specific shark catch data are provided by a small number of flag States.

Given the relatively low level of coverage in the operational-level logsheets, a more complete characterization of the longline fishery requires the use of the SPC-held aggregated (5\degree $\times$ 5\degree grid) data. Effort and reported shark catch data by flag at the aggregated level have a lower degree of spatial resolution but in most cases are raised to represent the entire WCPO longline fishery. Sets with observers present onboard, are shown for comparison (Figure \ref{fig:fig03}) but have a finer degree of spatial resolution due to observer record keeping. 

A comparison of longline effort by flag and the number of sharks recorded in logsheets was constructed (Figure \ref{fig:fig04}) by showing the top four fishing nations (in the WCPO as a whole) and aggregating the rest of the flag states to another group. If the fishing practices and reporting practices were more or less consistent across flags the numbers of sharks reported would be proportional, by flag, to the effort.

Comprehensive data on shark catches at high spatial resolution are available from observer data held by the SPC-OFP but, as described above, the overall coverage of these data is low, and much less than the required levels of ROP coverage. In addition, a comparison of longline effort and longline observer coverage (Figure \ref{fig:fig05}) reveals that the latter is disproportional by region and flag and thus cannot be considered representative of the fishery as whole.

Another aspect of the low data coverage problem is that of temporal representativeness on a month/year basis of the observed effort. A comparison of the number of sets observed by month - on a regional basis - shows significant fluctuations in the relative coverage of the observer data compared to the logbook data (Figure \ref{fig:fig06}).

A comparison of longline effort by flag and the number of sharks recorded in logsheets was constructed by showing the top four fishing nations (in the WCPO as a whole) and aggregating the  rest of the flag states to an other group. If the fishing practices and reporting practices were more or less consistent across flags the  numbers of sharks reported would be proportional, by flag, to the effort.

 \subsection{Purse Seine data} 
 %N.B. all the stats quoted here are in PS_oper_stats.r (JR)
Similar to the longline fishery, SPC-OFP holds logsheet data on shark catches by purse seine fisheries at both the operational and aggregate levels.  However, operational-level coverage for the purse seine fishery (87\%) is considerably higher than for the longline fishery (23\%). This factor, in combination with the more limited geographic range of the purse seine fishery, contributes to more representative operation-level coverage in the purse seine fishery than in the longline fishery.

Following implementation of the WCPFC ROP on 1 January 2010, in combination with prior observer coverage commitments by Parties to the Nauru agreement (PNA) members, 100\% purse seine observer coverage is now required (except for vessels fishing exclusively in one Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)). Historical observer coverage in the purse seine fishery has varied between EEZs. Coverage rates were low, generally less than 10\%, for the years 1995-2002, with coverage increasing to 10-18\% for the years 2003-2009. Recent (2010-2013) annual averages are between 42-56\% in total.


While observer coverage of the purse seine fishery is not uniformly representative (Figure \ref{fig:fig07}, orange points), it is more representative than observer coverage of the longline fishery, owing to both higher coverage levels and the more limited geographic range of the fishery (Lawson 2011). Regions 3 and 4 contain 98\% of the operational-level reported purse seine sets, and 99\% of observed sets and are thus the only regions for which purse seine analyses will be meaningful. Shark interactions are recorded in just 2.5\% of purse-seine operational logsheets (Figure \ref{fig:fig07}, red points), a value far lower than the 41\% recorded in longline operational-level logsheet. As a result, it is not possible to assess the number of shark interactions by set or the species involved using purse seine logsheet data.

A comparison by flag of purse seine effort and the number of purse seine sets reporting at least one shark interaction was constructed for associated (floating object) and unassociated (free-swimming) sets based on aggregated logsheet data (Figure \ref{fig:fig08}).  For each panel, flags were ranked by number of sets and the top four flags were plotted separately with all remaining flags aggregated into an "Other" category. Although estimated shark catches in the purse seine fishery are considerably lower than shark catches in the longline fishery (SPC 2008, Lawson 2011), it would still be expected that purse seine shark interactions are proportional to purse seine effort. However, from the discrepancies observed between the left and right panels, it appears that some major fishing nations are not submitting or are under-reporting their shark interactions.

\section{Distribution Indicator Analyses}
      \subsection{Introduction}

      Distribution indicators consider patterns in the geographic distribution of species catch. Spatial trends in fisheries data need to be interpreted carefully since they originate from a biased sampling design \citep{Walters2003_a}. If assessed carefully, however, they can provide useful insight into spatial and temporal trends in species distribution as well as highlight areas of strong interactions between a species and fisheries. In addition, changes in stock abundance might be reflected in distribution \citep{MacCall1990}, with increases and decreases in abundance resulting in range expansions and contractions, respectively. Such patterns have been reviewed at length in the terrestrial literature \citep{Borregaard2010_a} but less often for marine applications due to the paucity of historical data \citep[but see][]{Worm2011_a}. The indicators presented below are based on observer data and thus patterns in fishing effort and/or observer coverage may bias the results.  These results should therefore be interpreted as potential indicative of the location and intensity of interactions between these species and WCPO longline fisheries.  These indicators can be updated over time to determine if the spatial patterns change or temporal trends change.  More complex methodologies might also be applied to remove potential sampling biases.
      
      
      \subsection{Methods}
      In this study, we calculated four Distribution Indicators:
      
\begin{itemize}
\item	Species-occurrence.  This indicator summarizes the occurrence of a species in any longline set monitored by an observer.  A positive value at any given location simply indicates that the species in question was observed at least once, without regard to annual frequency or fishing effort.

\item	Proportion-presence.  This indicator provides a rough indicator of the frequency of occurrence of each shark species in each region and trends in presence over time.  Using observer data, the indicator is computed by dividing the total number of sets with at least one occurrence by the total number of sets in each region/year combination.
\item	High-CPUE.  This indicator is intended to illustrate which regions and years have shown relatively high CPUE values for the different species.  The index is constructed, again on the basis of observed longline sets, by computing mean CPUE within each 5\degree $\times$ 5\degree cell within each of the six regions, and then calculating the proportion of cells within a region that are above a specific threshold.  For this analysis, the threshold was set at 1 shark per 1000 hooks for blue shark and at 1 shark per 5000 hooks for the other species.
\item	Catch-Hotspot.  This indicator is an extension of the Species-occurrence and Proportion-presence indicators, and is intended to illustrate the possible presence of variable species catch hotspots.  All observed data sets are totalled within 1\degree $\times$ 1\degree cells over four separate five-year (pentad) periods.  The proportion of observed sets containing at least one species occurrence within that cell/pentad cell is then computed and mapped.  This Catch-Hotspot indicator provides better temporal resolution than the Species-occurrence indicator and better spatial resolution than the Proportion-presence indicator in helping to identify the distributional patterns of each shark species.
\end{itemize}



      \subsection{Results}
      \hlcyan{these figure labels to be changed in figure input}
      The four sets of Distribution Indicators are grouped in Appendix A, as follows: Species occurrence (Figures \ref{IA_01} to \ref{IA_07}), Proportion-presence (Figure \ref{IA_08}), High-CPUE (Figure \ref{IA_09}), Hot spot analysis (Figures \ref{IA_10} to \ref{IA_16}).  Species-specific results below reference these sets of figures.
      
        \subsubsection{Blue Shark}
Blue sharks are the most common and widely reported shark bycatch species in the WCPO longline fisheries.  They are found to occur through the range of longline fishing and have the highest proportion-presence rate in virtually all years and regions among the shark species analysed in this report.  Both the Proportion-presence and High-CPUE time series show distinct downwards trends from the late 1990s to the present in most regions (3, 5, and 6).  The Catch-hotspot indicator shows consistently high occurrence of blue shark in longline fishery around the Hawaiian Islands with occurrence generally declining to the south, before again increasing in frequency around 20\degree{}S.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Mako Shark}
Mako sharks are one of the most commonly captured shark species in the longline fisheries of the WCPO.  Mako sharks have been encountered in longline sets in all regions that observers have sampled.  The largest, most consistent, hotspots have included waters in Region 5 between Australia and New Zealand.  Spatially, there are differing trends over time in the Proportion-presence and High-CPUE indicators.  The north and west regions (2 and 3) show stable or slightly increasing rates (though data for region 2 is lacking for years 2012-2014) whereas the south Regions (5 and 6) show steadily declining rates.

         
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \subsubsection{Silky Shark}
 Silky sharks are commonly encountered in Regions 3 through 6 and at a very low rate in Region 2.  Neither the Proportion-presence nor High-CPUE indicators illustrate sustained temporal trends in occurrence.  The region with the greatest proportion of High-CPUE occurrence is Region 3.  The Catch Hotspot indicator also illustrates a consistency in both the temporal and spatial encounter of the LL fishery with silky sharks.
 %JR: For silky shark there seems to be a slight downward trend in the core regions of 3 and 4
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \subsubsection{Oceanic Whitetip Shark}
 Oceanic whitetip sharks also occur with regular frequency in observed longline sets through most of the WCPO longline fisheries.  In the five regions where they are commonly encountered (Region 1 contains few observed sets) the trend in both Proportion-presence and High-CPUE has been steadily downward since the mid-1990s, with some of the decline in rates exceeding 80\%.  Catch-hotspots for oceanic whitetip sharks have been in the central Pacific, particular the region surrounding the junction of Regions 3, 4, 5, and 6.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \subsubsection{Thresher Shark}
 Thresher sharks have been found in observed longline sets in most regions of the WCPO with the possible exception of the area around French Polynesia. Catch-hotspots have been north of the equator, especially in Region 4. Both the Proportion-presence and High-CPUE time series show indistinct temporal trends though Regions 3 and 4 have dropped considerably over the past five years.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \subsubsection{Hammerhead Shark}
 Among the shark species analysed in this report, hammerhead sharks have the lowest encounter rates (measured as Proportion-presence) and appear to be patchily distributed.  The regions with the apparent largest presence of hammerhead sharks is the Northeast (Hawaiian Islands) and Southwest (Papua New Guinea, Australia east coast).  Due to the low encounter rates, little inference can be made regarding temporal trends in occurrence.
         
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \subsubsection{Porbeagle Shark}
 Porbeagle sharks have historically only been encountered in the southern region of the WCPO, essentially only south of 20 \degree S (Regions 5 and 6).  A decrease in the spatial and temporal occurrence of porbeagle in observed sets is evident in the three Distribution Indicators other than Species-occurrence.  The porbeagle catch-hotspots have shrunk both in size and intensity over the four pentads; the Proportion-presence and High-CPUE time series for Regions 5 and 6 have declined as much as 90\% over the past 15 years.
 
%JR: Porbeagle sharks in region 5 and 6 show slightly increasing to stable trends.

      \hl{The following points were noted from the life stage and sex distribution plots:
- Adult blue sharks were more common than juveniles in the waters off Hawaii and at latitudes of 20$^{\circ}$S this corresponds to the blue shark mating ground proposed by Nakano (1994);

Interpretation of the distribution indicators is complicated by the influence of changes in fishing effort,  potential  changes in community composition, observational coverage  and operational factors influencing selectivity and catchability (e.g. depth and leader material). As such, these indicators are best used for identifying the areas in which species-fishery interactions take place, and as supporting information for interpreting other patterns and trends.

\section{Observed Species Composition Indicator Analyses}

 \subsection{Introduction}
<<<<<<< HEAD
Changes in the species composition of the catch can be one of the most direct indicators of fishing induced changes to the assemblage of fish encountered by the longline and purse seine fisheries over time.  Additional information on potential changes can be inferred by examining catch data on a finer basis, e.g., by separating longline sets by depth and purse seine sets by type of school association.  We rely upon observer sampling of individual sets for such analyses.  Additionally, by examining time series of catch composition we can ascertain whether there has been a decline in the percentage of unidentified sharks; improvements in observers' ability to identify sharks to the species level can help resolve or identify potential regional and temporal trends in abundance.

We compile the observer data to provide information on the relative proportion of key species in observer sample.  Nevertheless, it is an ongoing issue that observer sampling may not be representative of total catch composition due to issues of uneven coverage and low sample sizes.  Those issues are covered in detail in Lawson (2011). However, these data represent the best that we have and temporal/spatial changes in relative species composition can help identify population increases or decreases.  More direct species-specific analyses, such as summarized in section 5, should be performed to assess the veracity of identified abundance changes.

\hl{The species composition of the catch, as recorded by longline and purse seine observers, was examined to identify any apparent changes over time. This type of analysis reinforces the species-specific fishery interaction information above, but supplies more detail on interactions by separating longline sets by depth and purse seine sets by type of school association. Another important reason for examining catch composition indicators is to assess changes in the percentage of unidentified shark species over time. Improvements in the observers' ability to identify sharks could contribute to increasing occurrences of species-specific records in the observer database and could bias temporal trends.}
>>>>>>> origin/master

\hl{While this analysis provides information on the relative proportions of the key species within the observer samples, estimation of total catch composition and quantity is complicated by issues of observer sample coverage and representativeness (see Section 2) and is the subject of a separate analysis (Lawson 2011). Regardless of whether catch composition indicators are based on observer samples or the entire catch, changes in species composition over time can suggest relative population increases or depletions. However, species-specific catch rate analyses should be performed to directly assess whether actual abundances for individual species have changed (see Section 5).}

  \subsubsection{Longline}  
  
\hlcoral{Link to figures, change labels as needed in figure input}
With just a few exceptions, blue shark catch dominates the longline shark bycatch.  In Regions 2, 4, 5, and 6, blue sharks have average 60-90\% of shark bycatch; in Region 4 the proportion of blue shark has dropped from around 60\% in the late 1990s to 10-15 in recent years.  The second most common observation of shark species, in terms of numbers, is silky shark which have constituted a majority of shark bycatch in Region 3 since the early 2000s and have been on the order of 5-10\% in \ other regions.  We note that there appears to be a sudden increase in the proportion of silky shark catch for Region 4 in years 2012-2104.  In fact, this reflects the absence of observer data from the U.S. longline fleet operating around Hawaii which constituted the large majority of longline sets in that region dating back to the start of the time series.  As evidenced by the small number of observed sets shown for years 2012-2014, the shark composition data for these years in Region 4 are quite likely very unrepresentative.  Several of the other key shark species constitute up to 10\% of the shark bycatch in certain regions and time periods: porbeagle in Regions 5 and 6, oceanic white tip sharks in Regions 3, 4, and 6 and thresher sharks in regions 3 and 4.  The other, or non-key species, observed in Regions 5 and 6 were primarily composed of roughskin dogfish (Centroscymnus owstoni) and tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus), and in Region 3 were primarily composed of unidentified hammerhead, grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) and blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus) sharks. Unidentified sharks comprised no more than 1.6\% of the recorded sharks in any of the regions.

Division of the longline shark bycatch into shallow ($<$11 hooks per basket) and deep ($>=$11 hooks per basket) sets revealed several differences in the assemblage of sharks caught at depth.  Regions 3, 5, and 6 each have relatively large number of observed sets (Regions 1, 2 and 4 have essentially no observed sets in one or the other depth characterization) so we restrict our comparison to those Regions.  In the southern Regions (5 and 6), blue shark and porbeagle comprise as much as 95\% of the longline shark catch; the deep water sets contain a much more diverse array of species with silky, thresher, oceanic whitetip and mako sharks occurring in substantial numbers.  Differences in shark composition in Region 3 are much more subtle than Regions 5 and 6; hammerhead and oceanic white tip sharks are more common in deep sets while silky sharks are a bit more common in shallow sets. There was no strong indication of temporal trends specific to deep or shallow sets.

  
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \subsubsection{Purse Seine} 
<<<<<<< HEAD
\hlcoral{\#Link to figures}
The large majority of purse seine caught sharks have been identified to species in observer samples since the late 1990s.  Prior to that, it is likely that practical difficulties, such as sharks not being hauled aboard, resulted in non-identification.  Sample sizes were so small during that time period however, therefore it is difficult to generalize trends before 2000.  Overall, silky shark comprise at least 70\%, and often more than 90\%, of the sharks captured in purse seine sets; both in associated and unassociated sets.  Oceanic whitetip and hammerhead sharks have also been caught in non-negligible amounts.

=======
 \hllb{\#Not sure why this is highlighted... Steven? Joel?   JR edits - copied from previous report....}\\
 \hlcoral{\#Link to figures}
\hl{ Plots of the catch composition as recorded by observers in the purse seine fishery indicate that unlike for longlines, a non-negligible portion of the sharks recorded in the first half of the time series (1995-2003) were not identified to species (i.e. UID; Figure XXX). As discussed in Section 2, this is probably a function of the practical difficulties in recording purse seine-caught sharks which are not hauled onboard, but the problem appears to have been resolved in recent years. Overall, approximately 70\% of the observer-recorded catch was silky shark; the next most abundant species was oceanic whitetip shark which comprised 7\% of the records. The numbers of sets shown in the lower panels illustrate that associated sets comprised 67\% of the observer samples in Region 3 and 59\% of the samples in Region 4, but recorded 88\% and 93\% of the sharks respectively. It is also noted that oceanic whitetip sharks were observed in substantial numbers only in associated sets and only until 2004-2005.}
>>>>>>> origin/master
 
 \subsection{Conclusions}

The Species Composition indicators reveal that shark bycatch differs substantially between longline and purse seine fishing in the WCPO.  

Blue sharks are the most prevalent longline caught shark, but there are substantial regional and depth variations.  Several species are commonly caught more frequently in deeper sets; porbeagle form a sizeable component of the shallow sets in the regions where they occur (i.e. Regions 5 and 6) and silky shark is the second most common longline caught shark.

Purse seine shark bycatch is much less variable and is dominated by silky sharks, particularly over the past decade when the number of observed sets increased greatly and composition data may have become more representative.  In virtually all regions and years, silky shark comprises more than 95\% of the shark bycatch, with minor numbers of hammerhead and oceanic whitetip sharks occurring.  Oceanic white tip sharks appear to have been more common prior to 2000, their percentage contribution to the overall shark cath has not been more than 20\% in regions 3 and 4 for over a decade, which is stark contrast to the first ten years of the study period. 

% \hllb{\#Not sure why this is highlighted... Steven? Joel? - old conclusions should be deleted?}\\ 
% \hl{ The observed longline catch composition plots illustrate that blue shark dominate in most regions. An exception to this pattern is Region 3 where silky sharks, primarily from shallow sets, are the most frequently observed species. Although there are some minor differences in species composition between observed shallow and deep sets in other regions (e.g. Regions 2 and 4), these may be related to sampling representativeness. Analysis of observed purse seine shark catches reveals that silky sharks predominate with the majority of these found in associated sets. In previous years, oceanic whitetip shark was the second-most commonly identified shark in associated sets but this species has been only rarely observed in recent years.

\section{Biological indicator analyses}


      \subsection{Introduction}
Trends in a standardized measure of fish size can indicate changes in the age and size composition of the population, in particular, a decrease in size is expected in a population under exploitation (Goodyear 2003).  Previous analysis (Clarke et al. 2011) examined trends in median length of the key WCPFC shark species and found significant declines in most combinations of spatial strata and sex for blue and mako sharks, as well as silky sharks.  The magnitude of such change can, in theory, provide information on the level of exploitation that a fish stock is experiencing (Francis and Smith 1995). As the size of sharks differs by sex, it is important to examine indicators on a sex-specific basis where possible. 

In addition to identifying trends in size, length data can be used to assess whether the catch sample is sexually mature by comparing to species-specific lengths at maturity from the literature.  Length is a better measure of size than weight because the former does not fluctuate with reproductive or other seasonal factors. As noted in Francis et al. (2014), median length is preferred over mean length as the median is less likely to be influenced by outliers. 

The sex ratio of a shark population may also be a useful indicator of its status. Heavy exploitation could lead to a preferential loss of females because they tend to be larger and older than males. Thus, if the median length in a population declines, the sex ratio may also have been impacted. Additionally, male and female sharks often segregate spatially (Mucientes et al. 2009), and this has been reported in
highly migratory ("HMS") sharks in New Zealand waters, e.g. in the South region, females dominate the blue shark catch while males dominate the mako shark catch (Francis 2013). If fishing activity is concentrated in areas favoured by one sex, then an imbalance in the sex ratio could be created.

Life history and stage indicators examine the geographic range of each species and the habitat usage (in terms of geography only; oceanographic variables are not considered) by different life stages (adult/juvenile) and sexes based on fishery interaction data.  Many pelagic shark species are known to exhibit sex- and age- specific distribution patterns (Camhi et al. 2008, Mucientes et al. 2009) thus spatial analyses can highlight areas which are important to key life stages such as spawning or recruitment.

In this section we analyse trends in median length, proportion of females over time, and patterns of life history stage by sex.  
      

\subsection{Methods}\label{bi:methods}
%jr edits
Shark sex identification data from observer samples were aggregated by year and region to assemble estimates of trends in sex ratio.  The percent of female sharks by region and year are illustrated in Appendix Figure \ref{BI_01}.
  
For the nominal length analysis, length data from observer samples in longline and purse seine were assembled by region and year.  Observed length data from the purse seine fishery was limited to silky and oceanic whitetip sharks in regions 3 and 4, as sex is generally not recorded.  Length measurements were generally recorded as fork length; in those instances that data was recorded in total length, measurements were converted to fork length using conversion factors given in Table~\ref{tab:len_mat}. Those 5\degree $\times$ 5\degree cells for which the sample size was less than 20 individuals were removed from the analysis.  Due to small longline fishery sample sizes for longfin makos, and for bigeye, common and pelagic threshers, results for makos (two species plus unidentified) and threshers (three species plus unidentified) were grouped. Length at maturity data for shortfin mako, bigeye thresher, and scalloped hammerhead were chosen to represent each group, respectively, as both observer data and literature sources were greatest for these species (Table~\ref{tab:len_mat}). While length at maturity and conversion factors might be expected to vary by region within the WCPO, insufficient data
were available to support regional analysis. The median lengths, with 5th and 95th percentiles, were plotted for both sexes and all regions in Appendix Figures \ref{BI_02} to \ref{BI_08} (for the longline species) and Figures \ref{BI_09} and \ref{BI_10} (for purse seine species).  Length at maturity is included in each plot for purposes of comparison with median length.

In addition to the nominal analysis, and in order to account for potential influences on shark size due to changes in sampling effort, fork lengths from the longline fishery were standardized. This was accomplished using a GLM based on a normal distribution with factors year and 5\degree $\times$ 5\degree cell. The estimated model coefficients were used to predict shark lengths for each year for an arbitrarily chosen cell lying near the centre of each region. To more adequately capture the population trends, this analysis was carried out at stock level (north(Regions 3 and 4 combined) and south (Regions 5 and 6 combined)) for blue and mako sharks and regional level (Regions 3 to 6 combined) for silky, oceanic whitetip, hammerhead, thresher and porbeagle.  Additionally, visualization of trends in the annual change in standardized length was facilitated by fitting a loess smoother through the annual GLM coefficients.  Difficulties with standardization precluded the development of GLMS on purse seine length data. The results of the standardization are illustrated in Appendix Figures \ref{BI_11} to \ref{BI_17}

Time trends over the duration of each standardized length time series were estimated by fitting linear models to the annual GLM coefficients.  Linear model fits were produced separately for each species, sex, and stock.   The slope coefficients, which is the estimated annual change in length per year, are plotted in Figure \ref{BI_18}.  One important caveat when interpreting the results is that linear models generalize the direction and magnitude of the trend over the entire time series. Therefore, a size trend that rises at the start of the time series and decreases in the later part of the time series may be characterized as having no trend through time.


Patterns of occurrence by life history stage by sex were explored using the same dataset developed for the standardized length analyses.  Analyses were conducted for each species  across sex (male and female) and maturity (adult/juvenile), giving four plots of the proportionality of each sex:maturity stage.  The analyses were carried out for the entire time series, stratified by season,  May-July (mid year) and November -January(year-end); sharks sampled in other months were excluded from the analysis.  The life history stage and sex maps are illustrated in Appendix Figures \ref{BI_18} to \ref{BI_31}.  The maps were produced by shading each cell based on the proportion of individuals observed in each of the four subsets with darker colours indicating higher proportions. For example, if all of the silky sharks observed in a given cell were adult females the adult female panel would show a darkly shaded cell whereas the other three panels would show only the lightest shading (i.e. even zero proportions receive the lightest colour shading). 

% 
\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Sex-ratio}
    The proportion of observed females showed no clear trends over the entire study period for any of the sharks.  Fine scale analysis is difficult due to lack of continuous data and small annual sample sizes in the most recent years.   The sex ratio of blue shark in region 5 has has been skewed in favor of females for the entire data period. With the exception of blue shark in region 5 there is nothing to suggest that incidental catchability (availability) is greater for either sex for all species.
    
\subsubsection{Median length}
Blue shark females showed declining trends in regions 5 and 6, with stable trends in regions 2, 3, and 4 5. Male blue sharks exhibited similar trends with nearly all the observed blue sharks in region 5 being immature in recent years. 

Both male and female silky sharks showed declining trends in length in the core areas (regions 3 and 4) as well as region 5.  The majority of the silky sharks observed were immature throughout the study period. The only area  that showed increases in observed median length were regions 6 for males of both species. 

Length data for hammerhead sharks is largely limited to region 3 during the time period 1998-2008, during this time the majority of the observed sharks were immature. The limited length data in other regions indicates that the hammerhead sharks available to the longline fishery are mainly immature.

Male mako sharks showed the same trends as blue sharks with stable trends in regions 2, 3 and 4, with slightly declining trends in regions 5 and 6. Immature males were more commonly observed in regions 5 and 6 throughout the study.  Observed female and male were approximately the same size in all regions and median length was relatively stable over time.  As female length at maturity is at a much larger size than for males, the observed median length of females was considerably lower than length at maturity.

The trends in length for both female and male oceanic whitetip sharks were relatively stable in the core area (regions 3 and 4), with the majority of the observed sharks being immature.  

Porbeagle sharks were only observed in regions 5 and 6, where nearly every female and the majority of the male shaks were immature.  Increasing median length for both sexes was observed in region 5 since 2007; Region 6 showed no consistent trends.

The majority of observed thresher sharks occurred in region 4 where the lengths of both male and female sharks were relatively stable throughout the time period. Observed female thresher sharks were predominantly immature while male thresher sharks did not show any clear bias towards maturity.

\subsubsection{Standarized length}
Possible trends in length over time are more evident in the stardardized length plots when overplotted with a loess smoother.  For the great majority of species, sex and stock, standardized lengths have decreased over time.  The only exceptions are for the northern stock of mako (both species) and porbeagle females, which have essentially remained the same size.  The slope coefficients fitted to annual GLM coefficients show a decrease of around 0.2 to 0.4 cm/year for most of the other time series.  Southern male blue sharks showed the greatest decline in standardized length, with a negative slope coefficient of 0.6 cm/year.

\subsubsection{Life history stage and sex}
The following points were noted from the life stage and sex distribution plots:

 
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the south Pacific adult blue sharks and especially females were presesnt in the waters of New Caledonia and Fiji throughout the year, with higher proportions of adults present south of 20\degree only in the mid year. 
  \item Adult blue sharks were more common than juveniles in the waters off Hawaii and at latitudes of 20\degree S this corresponds to the blue shark mating ground proposed by Nakano (1994); the highest proportion of juvenile blue sharks was found in mid-year (May-July) samples in the southern extremities of the WCPO.
  \item  Juvenile silky sharks are present throughout the year in the waters between 10\degree north and 10\degree south, especially in waters around Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands
\item Juvenile hammerhead sharks were most commonly observed in the adjoining seas of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands' territorial waters.    Adult hammerheads were uncommonly observed in the same areas.  

\item Juvenile makos of both sexes were most frequently observed in the year end around the waters of southern Hawaii and during  mid-year (May-July), the waters around southern Australia New Zealand and to a extent Fiji.  

\item The observed distributions of oceanic whitetip are similar across sex and seasonality, with respect to maturity they are quite similar with adults occurring more in the north of Hawaii.

\item Thresher sample sizes were small and were mainly comprised of juveniles in tropical areas (especially off southern Hawaii) where they were seen year round. Large proportions of juveniles were observed in waters off New Zealand during the mid-year.
\end{itemize}

            
\subsection{Conclusions}

This Biological Indicators section examined trends in sex ratio, median length, standardized length and life history stage and sex.  The principal findings were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sex ratio of sharks in longline catches is approximately equal for all species and regions with the exception of blue sharks in Region 5, which are predominantly female.
\item Observed length was investigated by plotting the nominal median length trends and length at
maturity at the regional level. This indicated that the majority of the observed hammerhead, silky,
thresher, oceanic whitetip and porbeagle sharks were immature. Observed blue shark were mainly
immature in regions 5 and 6 and mainly mature in region 2.
\item The results of the length standardization indicate declines in most regions for most species based
on a linear model fit to the standardized annual lengths, with annual declines of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr.
\item The largest decline was seen for the southern stock of male mako sharks which have declined by 0.6 cm/yr
By contrast, slight increases in mean standardized length were seen for northern mako sharks (both sexes)
\end{itemize}

\section{Whale Sharks}
\hlgreen{reread: medium priority}
\hlcoral{\#This whole section, figure and table labels need to be fixed}\\ 

\hllb{\# Text from Joel, could be merged in section intro? Whale shark interactions are generally reported only by the purse seine fishery. }

For the purposes of this report, information on whale sharks has been retained in a separate section. For other key shark species the analyses described in this report have focussed on longline interactions with additional information from purse seines for some species in equatorial regions. For whale sharks, there are almost no interactions with longline gear. Whale shark interactions occur almost exclusively with purse seine fishing gear where tuna schools associated with whale sharks are either specifically targeted or else whale sharks are subsequently discovered to be associated with schools that were previously thought to be free school tuna aggregations.

Observations of whale sharks are subject to considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity and likely to have been affected by changes in observer coverage and reporting practices in recent years. The fate of whale sharks following interactions is also uncertain and information on key biological processes are limited. Given the current SPC data holdings only limited analysis for whale sharks in the WCPO is considered to be feasible.

The background to the original work by Harley et al. (2013) (for a full description of the analysis) was initiated from a request at WCPFC9 to add whale sharks to the list of key shark species and subsequently a conservation and management measure was adopted (CMM-2012-04).  This work is an update of the work produced by Harley et al. (2013) to include data up to 2014 looking at the spatial and temporal distribution of whale sharks in the western and central Pacific Ocean based on observer data collected from purse seine vessels (OFP, 2014).
  
\subsection{Data and Methods}
The observer data used in the analysis comprised all observed purse seine sets held by SPC for the last twelve years (2003-2014). Prior to the agreement of 100\% observer coverage in 2010, the observer data are not representative of the entire fleet with a strong bias towards US vessels, Pacific Islands fleets (under the FSM Arrangement) and those vessels fishing in the waters of Papua New Guinea.

Nevertheless, they represent over 200,000 observed sets over the past ten years (\hlcoral{Table 1}). To determine if a set encountered a whale shark in some way we used three criteria 1) if the set was labelled as a whale shark associated set as recorded on the observer PS-2 form; 2) whether the set caught a whale shark, from the observer PS-3 form; or 3) was an interaction reported, from the observer GEN-2 form.

As has been noted previously (Harley et al. 2013) not all whale shark associated sets necessarily result in the encirclement of the whale shark, and many of the whale shark interactions come from sets that were reported by the observer as a free school set because the whale shark was not noticed until after the set was made. 

The majority of the analysis in this paper relates to modelling the distribution of sets, whale shark records, and the `encounter rate' (whale shark records per set) at 1 $\times$ 1 \degree square resolution. It is important to note here, that the observer data are restricted in their coverage of the WCPO purse seine fishery with no coverage for the domestic purse seine operations within EEZ fisheries in Indonesia and the Philippines or the Japanese purse seine fisheries that operate in the North. Any hotspots identified in this paper are not necessarily the areas of highest density of whale sharks in the WCPO or even the equatorial part of the convention area.

CMM 2012-04 came into effect January 1st 2014, whale shark associated sets reported here may include whale shark target sets and some inadvertent catch where the shark was noticed during brailing.

As has been noted previously (SPC-OFP, 2011; Harley et al. 2013) not all whale shark associated sets necessarily result in the encirclement of the whale shark, and many of the whale shark interactions come from sets that were reported by the observer as a free school set because the whale shark was not noticed until after the set was made. 

\subsection{Results}
Nine hundred and forty-five observed sets were recorded as whale shark sets (criteria 1 above) and a further 931 sets met either criteria 2 or 3 (\hlcoral{Table 1}). This gave 1876 records of whale sharks from just over 200,000 observed sets. The data coverage increased dramatically in 2010 with the introduction of 100\% observer coverage so overall the data are biased toward recent years. The percentage of all sets that recorded some form of whale shark interaction has been just under 1\% except for the period 2006-2008 when it increased to just less than 1.5\% (\hlcoral{Figure 1}).

Aside from 2006 which had a large spike in the occurrence of whale sharks in free schools sets (2.5\%), there has been a general decline in the occurrence of whale sharks in free school sets with a mean encounter rate of around 1\%  until 2009 (ignoring 2006) and just under 0.5\% from 2010-2014 the last four years (\hlcoral{Figure 2}).  The pattern of whale shark distribution with fishing effort is very similar with the largest densities found in the Bismark and Solomon seas (\hlcoral{Figure 3}). However, the range of observations were found scattered across the western equatorial Pacific Ocean. In terms of the encounter rate there were some isolated areas where the rate of records per observed set were high but these were generally areas with low observed whale shark records, but even [relatively] lower observed effort. These areas included the south eastern corner of the Papua New Guinea EEZ in the Solomon Sea, the southwest corner of the EEZ of the Federated States of Micronesia, and some small parts of the Gilbert, Phoenix, and Line Islands groups.
  
\subsection{Discussion}  
Further to the work discussed by Harley et al. (2013) there have been no significant differences in the fishery for the past 2 years.  However, key areas of work have been identified within the shark research plan (see Brouwer and Harley, 2015).  In summary these include:-

\begin{itemize}
\item{} Updating the catch history.
\item{} Stock discrimination.
\item{} Development of a standardised CPUE index.
\item{} Observer form re-development process should include distinguishing between target whale shark sets and inadvertent catch.
\end{itemize}

It has been suggested (Clarke, 2015) that it is difficult to make accurate inferences about purse seine interactions with whale sharks from 2014 observer data as these data are under-estimates.  This was also the conclusion from the report conducted by SPC (SPC-OFP, 2011) which suggested that the proportion of whale-shark associated sets should be higher than that reported by observers. This is because more than two-thirds (73\% in both 2007-2009 and 2010) of the sets where whale sharks were encountered in the net (i.e. ``interactions") were not recorded as a ``whale shark-associated" set type.  One of the main reasons for this is that the whale shark may be not visible at the time of setting and so the set is recorded as another set type (e.g. ``unassociated, feeding on baitfish''). Subsequently, the observer discovers the animal in the net during the brailing process, and records it as an interaction. 

We therefore recommend revision of the observer data forms as soon as possible in order to distinguish between target whale shark sets and inadvertent catch so as to determine an accurate level of risk to whale shark mortality in the WCPO from purse seining.

\section{Feasibility of Stock Assessments}

Fisheries stock assessments are designed to provide stock status and management information via a population model that is scaled to the available data. Traditionally the data requirements include landings record or estimates of catch, abundance indices and biological information. For stocks that are not traditionally managed and considered bycatch (i.e. sharks), there are often short data series and data gaps for many species, estimates of removals are often highly uncertain and data poor methods or other alternatives may be more appropriate than full stock assessments. Here we consider each of the key shark species and the viability of a stock assessment or other population level study to provide stock status and management information.

\begin{description}
  \item[Blue shark (\emph{Prionace glauca})in the north Pacific] This species has been the subject of multiple stock assessments using both basic Bayesian production models and length based methods (SS3 and MFCL), there is sufficient data to develop reliable inputs for abundance indices and removals. Particular challenges exist for estimating catch and indices of abundance in areas where fishing behaviour has shifted towards targeting of sharks. 
  
\item[Blue shark (\emph{Prionace glauca}) in the south Pacific]
An analysis of the potential catch and CPUE series to support a stock assessment of blue shark in the south Pacific Ocean was presented at the SC9 (WCPFC-SC9-2013/SA-WP-04) and noted that in general the data exist to complete a stock assessment, however all data sets (observer, logsheet, aggregate) share the same characteristics of poor coverage with respect to space, time, or species identification. This study analysed only data from the WCPO convention area in the south Pacific, and it is likely that blue shark in the south Pacific are well mixed and would support a single south Pacific wide stock assessment. Although fisheries data in the south eastern Pacific exist, the data have not been analysed and no indication as to whether they would support a south pacific wide stock assessment can be given.

\item[Mako shark (\emph{Isurus oxyrinchus} and \emph{Isurus paucus} )in the north Pacific] The shark working group of the International Statistical Committee is currently working on an INDICATOR-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE STATUS OF SHORTFIN MAKO SHARK IN THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN. Preliminary results indicate that the indices of abundance, length information and size frequency data exist, though the extent to which this data can represent the entire north Pacific is unclear, there are connecting trends in abundance and problems with both shortfin and longfin mako being recorded as simply 'mako' shark. .

\item[Mako shark (\emph{Isurus oxyrinchus} and \emph{Isurus paucus} )in the south Pacific] Although no detailed study of the available data for mako sharks has been undertaken, this indicator analysis combined with the fact that mako sharks are often caught in the same fisheries as blue shark would indicated that sufficient data exist for a basic length based stock assessment in the southern portion of the WCPO.

%RDS - Ive commented this out because it talks about stock status rather than assessment possibility
%The available length composition data, by sex, in the south Pacific indicate that the majority of females, and more recently the majority of males observed are immature. 
%Nominal CPUE (region 6) is declining throughout the time period, while the proportion of positive sets is increasing. (RDS but CPUE is increasing in other regions)
 
 \item[Oceanic whitetip shark (\emph{Carcharhinus longimanus} ) ] Oceanic whitetip sharks in the WCPO were most recently assessed in 2012 (SC8) and at that time there was sufficient data to support an assessment for the period 1995-2009. In recent years longline observer coverage has dropped in the WCPO as observers have moved to purse seine vessels. At the same time increased reporting by species in the operational level logsheets has increased. It is unclear as to what the effect of these changes in data availability would have on a stock assessment, but given the exceptionally poor stock status based on the last assessment, another assessment is likely not to result in a significant change to stock status, so delaying a new assessment would be prudent.
% but given the unequiviocal stock status advice based on the last assessment,  another assessment si s likely not a priority.  

\item[Silky  shark (\emph{Carcharhinus falciformis} ) ] Silky sharks in the WCPO were most recently assessed in 2013 (SC9) and similar to oceanic whitetip, at that time there were sufficient data to support an assessment for the period 1995-2009. In recent years longline observer coverage has dropped in the WCPO as observers moved to purse seine vessels. At the same time increased reporting by species in the operational level logsheets has increased. It is unclear as to what the effect of these changes in data availability would have on a stock assessment, however silky sharks continue to be the most commonly observed shark it region 3 for both longline and purse seine, as well as in region 4 for purse seine. These factors indicate that a stock assessment of silky sharks is feasible.

\item[ Thresher shark (\emph{ Alopias superciliousus, vulpinus, \& pelagicus}) ]  Thresher sharks are mainly present in the longline observer data in region 4. %(ref FIG_xx_obs_shks ). 
They are represented by three species but often identified only as 'Thresher'.   Catch rate analysis by species is constrained by limited data in space and time and would be better performed by species but was constrained due to limited data and produced no clear trends for the group. A limited stock assessment for all combined species is possible, though the results would be difficult to interpret on a species specific level, and therefore would have limited ability to inform management decisions.

\item[ Hammerhead Sharks (\emph{ Sphyrna mokarran, lewini, zygaena \& Eusphyra blochii}) ]  Observations of hammerhead sharks are virtually non-existent in the purse seine database and mainly limited to regions 3 and 5 in the longline database. Further complicating the analysis is that more than half of the observations in the study period (1995-2014) were recorded as generic 'hammerhead' category. A stock assessment for this species is not feasible given the current data. 
%Information on key biological processes are limited and often based on small sample sizes %JR edit, don't know if true for all species

\item[ Porbeagle Sharks (\emph{ Lamna nasus}) ] Porbeagle sharks are generally considered a wide ranging oceanic species, in the Pacific they are distributed throughout the southern temperate and cold waters. Observed catch of porbeagle sharks are mainly limited to the Australian and New Zealand EEZs, however, other data do exist, such as operational logsheet data and potentially observer data from the CCSBT. Given the current SPC data holdings limited analysis for the WCPO would be feasible, but it is likely that other organisations could undertake a Southern Ocean wide assessment.

\item[ Whale Shark (\emph{ Rhincodon typus}) ] Whale sharks are observed in small numbers in the purse seine fishery, however, large data gaps exist from some key areas. A formal stock assessment for them is unlikely to be successful at this time, however, with prolonged and complete observer coverage one may become possible in future.

\section{Impact of Recent Shark Management Measures}

A general Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) aimed at managing sharks within the WCPFC was developed in 2006 (CMM2006-05). This measure was subsequently updated and refined in 2008 (CMM2008-06), 2009 (CMM2009-04) and 2010 (CMM2010-07), in addition specific measure have been developed for oceanic whitetip sharks (CMM2011-04); whale sharks (CMM2012-04) and silky sharks (CMM2013-08). The general shark measure has evolved over the years but currently requires accurate reporting of key shark species, encourages live release of sharks and attempts to address issues of fining through a 5\% fin to carcass ratio. In addition, CMM2014-05 was developed to limit the use of wire traces and shark lines in tuna and billfish target longline sets.

The species specific measures all have a retention ban, reporting requirements and the whale sharks measure also prohibits specific targeting of purse seine sets on whale sharks. Notes on specific CMMs include:
\begin{description}
 \item[CMM 2010-07 Conservation and Management Measure for Sharks] This CMM was originally designed to encourage full utilization of retained sharks, among the components of this measure was the requirement that vessels shall have on board fins that total no more than 5\% of the weight of sharks on board up to the first point of landing. This CMM replaced Conservation and Management Measure 2009-04, which was similar and an extension of CMM 2008-06, which was an extension of CMM 2006-05, which originally went into force on January 1st 2008. Observer records indicate a change in the observed practices of dealing with sharks in the purse seine fishery from the year 2008 to 2009 (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_wcpo}, bottom panel). 
The proportion of sharks that were finned was significantly reduced and the proportion discarded increased and has been approximately 80-100\% from 2009-2014. During this time the coverage of the purse seine fleet increased significantly, so the dramatic decrease in the proportion finned may partly be an artefact of a more extensive sample of the fleet, thought the CMM likely had some impact in the changes of handling sharks. Observer data for the key shark species in the longline fishery indicates that the years preceding the CMM were similar (with respect to the fate of sharks) as to those after, with an increase in the number of sharks retained (carcass along with fins as per the CMM) evident in recent years.
 
 
 \item[CMM 2011-04 Conservation and Management Measure of Oceanic Whitetip Shark] This CMM went into force on January 1, 2013, as such there should be a reduction in the proportion of retained and finned oceanic white tip sharks over the period 2013 and 2014. The measure aimed at the reduction in mortality of oceanic whitetip sharks in part because it was noted that the 5% fin to carcass requirement doesn't necessarily lead to a reduction in mortality, as a result this measure was designed to prohibit the retention (and finning) of oceanic whitetip. Observations of oceanic white tip sharks in the longline fishery have generally indicated reduction in the proportion finned since the mid-2000s (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_ocs}). However, proportionally more oceanic whitetip sharks were retained in 2013 (the first year of the CMM). With respect to the purse seine fishery, the proportion of oceanic whitetip sharks that were either finned or discarded increased, but the proportion retained decreased  (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_ocs}).  It seems that this measure is partially successful.


\item[CMM 2013-08 : Conservation and Management Measure for Silky Shark]. This measure is specifically a no retention measure for silky sharks, and went into effect July 1 2014. We do not expect to see the impact of this measure as the most recent data are from December 2014. 

\item[CMM 2014-05 : Measures for longline fisheries targeting tuna and billfish.] This CMM  states: 
      CCMs shall ensure that their vessels comply with at least one of the following options:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item  do not use or carry wire trace as branch lines or leaders; or
            \item  do not use branch lines running directly off the longline floats or drop lines, known as shark lines. 
           \end{enumerate}
This CMM goes into effect on July 1 2015 so no assessment of it is possible at this stage. However, the analysis carried out by SPC OFP (Rice and Harley 2012, Bromhead et al 2013, Canaco \& Donovan 2014) in recent years showing the effect of wire trace and shark lines on the catch rate of sharks indicates that if the measure is adhered to it should reduce the catch rates of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks.

 \end{description}
 % wrap up paragragh,  
Among the CMMs to have been passed to date, the ones we would mostly see an impact from would be CMM2010-07 which stipulates the 5\% fin to carcass ratio, and CMM 2011-04 which prohibits retention of oceanic whitetip. Overall there has been a trend in the purse seine fishery to greater discards and less finning, while retention and escape remain  uncommon observations in the purse seine fishery. The largest change in the observations of shark fate in purse seine fisheries came in 2009, the year after  CMM2010-07 came into effect.  In 2009, the proportion of sharks observed finned decreased by half and remained at low levels in the following years.  This reduction in finning may be attributable to that CMM.   
Observations of  oceanic white tip sharks in the  longline  fishery have shown that the CMM is not being strictly followed. 
Non-negligible proportions of oceanic whitetips are being retained, though there were no observations of oceanic whitetip sharks being finned in 2014.  
The analysis of this CMM in the purse seine fishery is hampered by the fact that there were no observations of oceanic whitetip sharks in 2014 (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_ocs}).  
Proportionally  more oceanic whitetip sharks were retained in 2013 (the first year of the CMM) than 2012,   With respect to the purse seine fishery,the proportion of oceanic whitetip sharks that were either finned or discarded increased, but the proportion retained decreased (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_ocs}).  It seems that this is only partially working.

\section{Conclusions }
% nb this part has been updated with new percentages, but the words are straight out to 2011, text is still highlighted becausee the data  'issues' are the exact same.....

This paper examines data held by the SPC-OFP for longline and purse seine fisheries in the WCPO to makes inferences regarding the populations of key shark species in the WCPO. The data sets analysed - observer, logsheet and aggregated data - vary in coverage, representativeness and detail, and in general are not oriented at reporting information on bycatch species such as sharks. Logsheet data at the operational level is most useful in assessing shark catch and catch rates in the WCPO as a whole, however, such data are available in the longline fishery for 41\% of the sets in 1995-2014 for the WCPFC Statistical Area as a whole, but there is little or no coverage in the northwest Pacific. Most of the operational-level longline logsheet sets (59\%) did not record sharks, in contrast \hlcoral{XX\%} observer data for longline did, possible explanations for this discrepancy include under-reporting of sharks or that the observer data are not representative of the fishing methods/areas/time periods of the longline fleet as a whole.

Operational-level coverage in the purse seine fishery is considerably higher (87\%), but only 2.5\% of purse seine operational-level logsheet sets reported any shark interactions. In both fisheries, most reported shark interactions are not species-specific, given these limitations, aggregated data (5\degree $\times$ 5\degree square) were used to characterize effort, observer coverage and re-ported shark catch by flag for both longline and purse seine fisheries. For longlines, this analysis showed clear evidence of non-/under-reporting of sharks by several major longline fleets. It also demonstrated that observer coverage is disproportional by region and flag and to an extent month thus they are not entirely representative of the fishery. Although the same non-/under-reporting patterns were observed in the purse seine aggregated data, observer coverage in the purse seine fishery is more representative by region and flag. Nevertheless observer data on purse seine-caught sharks are limited by the physical practicalities of on board sampling and the lower diversity of sharks encountered relative to the longline fishery.

% Distribution Indicators 
With the exception of 2014 total effort in the longline fleet has increased, through the study period (1995-2014) to approximately 800 million hooks annually with nearly half occurring in regions 3 and 4. With the exception of blue shark the high-CPUE indicates more or less steady trends for all species in all regions, however, this analysis was hampered by the lack of data throughout the region for species. Notably the proportion of high-CPUE cells for blue shark was decreasing thought the study period for regions 3, 5 and 6 with steady or slightly decreasing trends in region 3 and 4, region 1 was data deficient. Interestingly the percentage of positive sets for blue shark showed the opposite trend, increases in regions 3, 5 and 6 with flat trends in regions 2 and 5. For silky shark there seems to be a slight declining trend in the core regions of 3 and 4, while oceanic whitetip sharks show flat to slightly increasing trends throughout all of the regions. Porbeagle sharks in region 5 and 6 show slightly increasing to stable trends. Mako sharks show slightly increasing trends in region 5 and 6, stable trends in regions 3 \& 4 and a slightly decreasing trend in region 2, though data is lacking for years 2012-2014. The proportion of positive sets for thresher sharks showed steady trends throughout the regions, however, region 4 where the majority of threshers were observed in recent years, an increase in the proportion of positive sets was evident. Hammerhead sharks had consistent, near zero proportion of positive sets. 
\\
% spec comp
The observed longline catch composition plots illustrate that blue shark continue to dominate the observed catch in most regions. An exception to this pattern is Region 3 where silky sharks, primarily from shallow sets, are the most frequently observed species. Although there are some minor differences in species composition between observed shallow and deep sets in other regions (e.g. Regions 2 and 4), these may be related to sample representativeness. Note that declining trends in the number of sharks observed in all regions (except region 3) are partially a result of the reduction in observer coverage since 2010. In recent years more silky sharks have been observed in region 3 than prior to 2008, while the proportion of blue sharks observed during 2014 in regions 2-5 is one of the lowest on record. The analysis of observed purse seine shark catch revealed that silky sharks are the most common shark species observed with the majority of the catch occurring in associated sets. In previous years, oceanic whitetip shark was the second-most commonly identified shark in associated sets but this species is now rarely observed. Substantial numbers of sharks caught by purse seines were unidentified prior to 2002-2003.

% cpue
CPUE discussion here. Recent work by \citet{Clarke2011_a} noted gaps in observer data in terms of time and  space continuity, reporting rate, and identification with respect to sharks.
\\
% bio
The biological indicators showed that with a few exceptions (blue shark in region 5) the observed
sex ratio in the longline fishery is approximately equal. Sex ratio analysis was not possible for
the purse seine fishery. Observed length was investigated by plotting the nominal median length
trends and length at maturity at the regional level. This indicated that the majority of the observed
hammerhead, silky, thresher, oceanic whitetip and porbeagle sharks were immature. Observed blue
shark were mainly immature in regions 5 and 6 and mainly mature in region 2. The results of the
length standardization indicate declines in most regions for most species based on a linear model fit
to the standardized annual lengths. These results mirror the larger scale population trends in length
for the longline Fishery and the population level trends in silky and oceanic whitetip sharks in the
purse seine Fishery. Overall the biological indicators showed that by in large the longline fishery is
interacting with smaller immature sharks of both sexes.

Of all the CMMs to have been passed the only ones we should see an impact from would be CMM2010-07 which stipulates the 5\% fin to carcas ratio, and CMM 2011-04 which prohibits retention of oceanic whitetip. 
Overall there has been a trend in the purse seine fishery to greater discards and less finning, while retention and escape remain  uncommon observations in the purse seine fishery.
The largest change in the observations of shark fate in purse seine fisheries came in 2009, the year after CMM2010-07 (rather its predecessor) came into effect.  In 2009 the proportion of sharks observed finned decreased by half and remained at low levels in the following years.  This reduction in finning may be attributable to that CMM.   
Observations of  oceanic white tip sharks in the  longline  fishery have shown that the CMM is not being strictly followed. 
Non-negligible proportions of oceanic whitetips are being retained, though there were no observations of oceanic whitetip sharks being finned in 2014.  The analysis of this CMM in the purse seine fishery is hammpered by the fact that there were no observations of occeanic whitetip sharks in 2014  (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_ocs}).  
Proportionally  more oceanic whitetip sharks were retained in 2013 (the first year of the CMM) than 2012,   With respect to the purse seine fishery,the proportion of oceanic whitetip sharks that were either finned or discarded increased, but the proportion retained decreased (Figure~\ref{fig:fate_ocs}).  It seems that this is only partially working.

\section{Research Recommendations and Management Implications}

This indicator analysis provides informative insights into silky shark, oceanic whtitetip, mako shark, blue shark, whale sharks and porbeagle sharks, but is somewhat limited in the amount of inference possible for hammerhead and thresher sharks largely due to lack of data. These species are not commonly caught in the primary fisheries in the WCPO, and are historically not well reported. Increased observer monitoring is vital to the continued understanding of the less common key shark species. Specific research recommendations include: 
 
 \begin{itemize}
\item Research to assess the discrepancy between shark reporting in logbooks and observer data.  
\item Silky shark and oceanic whitetip sharks have been declining under recent fishing pressure, and likely maintain their overfished status. The last assessment for both of these species used data from 1995-2009, at this point we could easily add another 5 years of data to these assessments, though this would be most useful for silky shark to understand how its stock status has changed in recent years in conjunction with the new CMM's. If the population of oceanic whitetip shark doubled or halved, it would still be overfished.
\item The authors recommend that stock assessments be scheduled for blue sharks in the south Pacific, mako sharks, oceanic whitetip sharks (in the WCPO and Pacific wide) and silky sharks within the next five years.   
\item As the assessments generally start well into the catch histories of these species (e.g. the longline fisheries began in the 1950s but the assessment periods start in the 1990s), an investigation the initial depletion levels for assessed shark stocks should be undertaken. This would include developing catch histories for these species. 
\item Catch histories for all species, and an analysis of species composition of the catch for hammerhead and thresher sharks would also be informative and make some informative analyses possible in future. 
\item Assessing overall mortality rates is an important component of assessing the stocks. We currently have no informative data on post-release mortality rates of silky, oceanic whitetip and whale sharks. As all three species have non-retention management arrangements post-release survival rates are essential for monitoring the effectiveness of these measures. This work will also require an update to the wat the observers collect release information and an update of the observer forms and data collection procedures will be required. 

\item The authors recommend that this be undertaken again in 2-3 years with a stock assessment for BSH in the south Pacific, and another silky shark assessment in the intrim.
