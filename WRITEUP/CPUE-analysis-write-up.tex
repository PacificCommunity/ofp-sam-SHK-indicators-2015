Porbeagle not found in north so removed hemi
Mako + blue south and north stocks (see Clarke 2011... or other refs)

\subsubsection{Note on interactions between year and observer program}

% residuals: qqnorm overall summary and residuals vs. explanatory factors
\subsection{Notes on the use of error distributions} Error distributions for by-catch species have been discussed at length in previous publications as these data are notoriously hard to model properly due to the high proportion of zeroes \citep{...}. We achieved significant improvements in model diagnostics by allowing multiple parameters in the error distribution to be fit. This is because often accounting for the large amount of zeroes in shark CPUE catch data comes at the expense of modelling large catch events, since the dispersion is assumed to be constant for all factors. This is especially a problem when the mean of the distribution is close to zero or one, as in those instances the probability of getting large events if mostly controlled by the dispersion parameter (unlike when the mean is larger and the tail is not as pronounced). However, whenever conditions are good for sharks or targeting takes place, larger catch events can happen and not modelling them properly means we are missing important drivers. Typically, this can seen as a bump in the right-hand side of qqnorm plots.

Because flag and observer programs are highly correlated, we used
observer program as an explanatory categorical variable as it tended
to explain a higher proportion of the data when used on its own than
flag. We also explored adding an interaction between year and observer
program, as for some species of less mobile sharks we could expect to
see local trends in annual abundance that are reflected in the
observer program data. We checked for the relevance of including
interactions early in the model selection process, and proceeded with
an interaction for the remaining of the model selection if the AIC
score when interactions are allowed is at least 50 lower than with
additive effects only.

Hooks-between-floats on its own explains little variation, probably
because it only matters when looked at within specific levels of
other factors (see Fig ... -- panel observers).

\subsection{Model structure by species}
in appendix: summarize proportion of data removed for each species (temperature, observer, quantile), e.g. North Mako: removing HW removes a lot of data!! check for catches...
